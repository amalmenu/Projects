Virtual Air Canvas

Object Tracking in Computer Vision:

  Detection: Identifying objects within a frame.
  Tracking: Monitoring the movement of the detected objects across frames.
  Analysis: Understanding and interpreting the behavior of the tracked objects.

Color Detection:

 Color detection is a powerful image processing technique that identifies colors within a
 specific range in the HSV colorspace.

Project Overview:

 This project focuses on creating an Air Canvas using MediaPipe, OpenCV and Python.
 Air Canvas: A digital canvas that allows users to draw in the air using motion tracking
 and color detection.
